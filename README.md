Project Title: Caesar Cipher Text Encryption/Decryption Application
# Caesar Cipher Text Encryption/Decryption Application

## Description

The application is designed to encrypt plaintext using a key to produce a cipher text. Additionally, the application can decrypt cipher text back to plaintext, given the correct key.

## Features

- **Encrypt plaintext using a key**: Generate cipher text from the provided plaintext and key.
- **Decrypt cipher text using the correct key**: Reveal the original plaintext from the provided cipher text and key.

## Requirements

- **User input for plaintext and key**: Allow users to input the text they want to encrypt or decrypt and the key to be used.
- **Encryption algorithm**: Implement an algorithm to generate cipher text from plaintext using the given key.
- **Decryption algorithm**: Implement an algorithm to revert cipher text to plaintext using the correct key.
- **Proper error handling**: Ensure the application handles errors gracefully, such as invalid inputs or keys.
To display the project demo link in a README using Markdown and provide a brief description of how the app works, you can structure it like this:

### Project Demo

You can access the live demo of the project [here](https://ceaser-cipher-six.vercel.app/).

### Solution Description

**Encryption and Decryption Process:**

1. **Encrypting a Plaintext:**
   - Enter the plaintext you want to encrypt into the designated input box.
   - Select a numeric key by using the navigation arrows provided (increase or decrease).
   - Click on the **Encrypt** button to generate the encrypted text.

2. **Decrypting an Encrypted Text:**
   - Copy the encrypted text that you want to decrypt.
   - Paste the encrypted text into the plaintext input box.
   - Choose the correct key that was used for encryption from the numeric key options.
   - Click on the **Decrypt** button to retrieve the original plaintext.

   Note: If an incorrect key is selected during decryption, an error message will be displayed indicating that decryption failed.

This structure provides a clear guide on how to interact with your Caesar Cipher application and ensures that users can understand the functionality easily.
